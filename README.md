# 🚀 CodeUprising

> **From Contest to Commit — Rise with Your Code!**

Welcome to **CodeUprising**, the official competitive programming repository for our tech team! This is where we sharpen our problem-solving skills, collaborate on solutions, and track our progress in coding contests.

## 📋 About

**CodeUprising** is a team activity initiative where we participate in competitive programming contests on platforms like **CodeChef** and **LeetCode**. Team executives submit their solutions via Pull Requests (PRs), which are then reviewed and merged by the Tech Head.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Enhance problem-solving and coding skills
- Foster collaborative learning
- Build a comprehensive solution repository
- Track team progress in competitive programming

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

1. **File Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your solution files
   - For CodeChef: Use problem codes (e.g., `PARITY.cpp`, `MAKEPAL.py`)
   - For LeetCode: Use problem names in kebab-case (e.g., `two-sum.cpp`)

2. **Code Quality**: 
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow language-specific best practices

3. **Contest Folder Naming**:
   - CodeChef: Use contest names like `STARTERS_110`, `LUNCHTIME_105`
   - LeetCode: Use format like `Weekly_Contest_372`, `Biweekly_Contest_120`

4. **Optional README**: Add a `README.md` in your contest folder with:
   - Contest date and link
   - Problem descriptions
   - Your approach/explanations
   - Time and space complexity

5. **One PR per Contest**: Submit all problems from a single contest in one PR
